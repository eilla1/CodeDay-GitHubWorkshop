#### Common Mistake

# Git != Github

We‚Äôll go over this in the next few slides!

---

# They're not unrelated!

Git and Github work hand in hand to provide a better experience to developers. It‚Äôs neat stuff!

---

# What is Git?

- Version Control System (track changes made to the code)
- Without VCS:
  - You make changes to your code and it fails :(
  - You can‚Äôt go back to the old working version of the code (unless you undo a bunch of times, which is hectic and unreliable)
- With VCS:
  - You make changes to your code and it fails :(
  - No worries, we can revert back to the old version that works!
  - Problem solved and you didn‚Äôt spend hours patching the broken code (maybe also mending your fingers from undoing your changes)

---

# More On Version Control

- Version Control Systems allow us to track changes made to files.
- Git is one of a number of options, some others being Subversion and Mercurial.
- Git is a _Distributed Version Control System_, meaning that it does not require a central server‚Ä¶
- Though most teams use a centralized model..
- You can interact with git from the command line or through a GUI, like GitKraken, SourceTree, or Github Desktop.
- Many IDEs also have git integration

---

# The Git Repository

- `.git` keeps a set of files and metadata that track the history of your codebase.
- Files like `.gitignore` help you configure and control your repository.
- You can create a repository by running `git init`
- ou can start using an existing repo by running `git clone`
- When you clone a repository, you are creating a local copy of the repository. Once you start making changes, the local repo will no longer be identical to the remote.

---

# Local vs Remote

- The local repo is the one you make changes on.
- When you‚Äôve made changes, you can push those to the remote. If you need to get changes someone else has made, you pull from the remote.
- There are plenty of places to host a git repository. Probably the most widely known is Github.

---

# What is GitHub?

- Github is a platform to host git repositories
- If Git repositories are like buildings, Github would be the city that has the buildings
- You can also make forks of repositories with different branches
- Let‚Äôs say you make some changes to your fork of a repository and want those changes to actually be implemented, you can submit a pull request.
- A pull request is basically you asking the managers of the official repository, ‚ÄúHey, could you put my changes into the actual thing?‚Äù

---

# Git Flow

- Git flow is one workflow model for git.
- It is not the _only_ way to use git with a team. It is a very common model to follow, but remember that the best way to use git is the one that helps your team stay productive.
- `main` branch
- Development `dev` branch
- Feature branches

---

# Merge Conflicts

- A merge conflict occurs when two different commits edit the same file
- Git will attempt to resolve them automatically, but sometimes it fails
- If you `git merge` and encounter a conflict, you can fix it with any text editor.
- Merge conflict marks in a file start with `<<<<<` and end with `>>>>>`.

---

```
<<<<<
This is the code you introduced in your branch
======
This is the code in the other branch
>>>>>
```

---

# Code Reviews

- Code reviews are a critical part of any development process.
- You can set the bounds and rules of what a code review entails.
- Pull requests in Github are a good way of managing code reviews.
